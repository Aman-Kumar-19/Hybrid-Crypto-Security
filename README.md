# 🔒 Hybrid Cryptographic Approach for 5G/B5G Security  

## 🌟 Abstract  
The rapid evolution of 5G and beyond (B5G) networks has introduced significant security challenges, necessitating advanced cryptographic mechanisms to protect sensitive data during transmission. Traditional encryption models often struggle to balance security, computational efficiency, and adaptability to dynamic network conditions. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel hybrid cryptographic framework integrating the AES, DES, and RSA encryption. AES and DES provide high-speed symmetric encryption, ensuring efficient data protection, while RSA enables secure key exchange and authentication. The integration of dynamic round keys enhances encryption complexity, improving resistance against cryptanalytic attacks. Performance evaluation, including encryption and decryption time analysis, total encryption time versus data size, and throughput assessment, demonstrates that the proposed framework optimally balances security and computational overhead. Benchmark comparisons indicate that AES-DES encryption achieves superior performance in handling bulk data, while RSA ensures robust authentication with minimal system impact. The results highlight the trade-off between security and processing efficiency, with CPU utilization stabilizing under high workloads. Furthermore, multi-threading and hardware acceleration significantly enhance cryptographic performance, ensuring seamless real-time encryption for high-speed 5G/B5G communications. Built for scalability and flexibility, this encryption paradigm meets the developing security needs of future-generation wireless networks placing it as a powerful and effective solution for protecting data in high-speed environments.
